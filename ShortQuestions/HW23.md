1. We write generic methods with a single method declaration, and we can call them with arguments of different types. The compiler will ensure the correctness of whichever type we use.

5.  **Eager Load**
```
public class {

    private static Singleton instance = new Singleton();
    
    private Singleton() {};
    
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }    
}

Singleton.getInstance();
```

**Lazy Load**

The Singleton instance is created when SingletonHolder class is loaded and initialized.
This occurs only when the getInstance() method is called for the first time, ensuring lazy initialization. 
This approach guarantees that the Singleton instance is created only once. 
```
public class Singleton {
    private Singleton() {}
    
    
    private static class SingletonHolder {
        private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();
    }
    
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return SingletonHolder.INSTANCE;
    }
}
```

6. Runtime exceptions are internal to your application but are not typically recoverable

* Example1: an object that is expected to have a value but is actually null. In this case, a NullPointerException exception would be thrown.

* Example2: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs while processing an array and asking for a position that does not exist within the size of the array. 

7. NullPointerException is raised in an application when we are trying to do some operation on null where an object is required. 

```
String s = null;

for (char c : s.toCharArray() {
    System.out.println(c);
}
```
in this example, the program will throw a NullPointerException since s.toCharArray() can not be called to a null String

8. The Optional class is a container object which is used to contain a value that might or might not be present. 

Optional class reduce the number of null checks in code. With Optional, you can write cleaner and more concise code that is easier to maintain.
   Also, you are less likely to miss important checks in your code and reduces the risk of NullPointerException. 
9. A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. Functional interfaces are included in Java SE 8 with Lambda expressions and Method references in order to make code more readable, clean, and straightforward.
10. A lambda in Java essentially consists of three parts: a parenthesized set of parameters, an arrow, and then a body, which can either be a single expression or a block of Java code. 
```
list.forEach(pair -> return pair[0] + pair[1]);
```
11. A method reference can be defined as a shorthand syntax of lambda expressions that are loaded with only one method call. A method reference is an alternative to creating an instance of a reference type.
```
list.forEach(pair::getPairSum);
```
12. The biggest new feature of Java 8 is language level support for lambda expressions. 
13. Inside lambda expression, we can use unchanged variable outside, but we can't assign new value to some local variable declared outside of the lambda expression.
The rule of final is also applicable for method parameters and exception parameters. 
14. Lambda Expressions − a new feature of the language that allows us to consider actions as objects. Method References − allow us to define Lambda Expressions by explicitly referring to methods by their names. 
15. Functional interface can inherit another interface if it contains only static and default methods in it. However, A functional interface can't extend another interface which has an abstract method, because it will void the fact that a functional interface allows only one abstract method. 
16. lambda expression is an anonymous method, that is a method without any name, designed specifically for the inline implementation of a method, java method reference is almost similar to Lambda expression, except it refers a method without executing it. 
17. Lambda expressions are the implementation of the functional interface. A functional interface is an interface that has only one abstract method. 
18. java method reference is almost similar to Lambda expression, except it refers a method without executing it. It uses the ``(::)`` operator to separate the method name from the name of an object or class.
19. ``String::valueOf`` is a method reference that refers to the valueOf method of the String class. It has the same result as ``String.valueOf()``; 
20. Intermediate operations, such as filter, map, and sorted, return a new stream and are lazily evaluated, meaning they are only executed once a terminal operation is invoked. Terminal operations, including forEach, collect, min, and max, produce the final results of the stream. 
21. filter, mao, sorted 
22. findAny() methods returns any element from a stream, while the findFirst() method returns the first element in the stream. 
23. Collections are used to store and group the data in a particular data structure like List, Set or Map. But, streams are used to perform complex data processing operations like filtering, matching, mapping etc on stored data such as arrays.
