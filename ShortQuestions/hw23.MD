1. What is generic in Java?  and type the generic code by yourself.

Generics allow classes, interfaces, and methods to operate on types specified during execution.
When we compile a Java program that uses generics, the compiler erases the type information, so it is not available at runtime.

2.  Read those codes and type it one by one by yourself. Then push the code to your
    branch.

5.  Write the Singleton design pattern include eager load and lazy load.

```
public class EagerSingleton {

    private static final EagerSingleton instance = new EagerSingleton();

    private EagerSingleton() {}

    public static EagerSingleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}

public class LazySingleton {
    private static LazySingleton instance;

    private LazySingleton() {}

    public static synchronized LazySingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new LazySingleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

6.  What is Runtime Exception? could you give me some examples?

RuntimeException is the superclass of those exceptions that can be thrown during the normal operation of the Java Virtual Machine.
Examples include NullPointerException, IndexOutOfBoundsException, IllegalArgumentException.

7. Could you give me one example of NullPointerException?

```agsl
String text = null;
int length = text.length(); // This will throw a NullPointerException.
```

8.  What is the Optional class?

The Optional class is a container object used to contain not-null objects. Optional object is used to represent null with absent value.

9.  What are the advantages of using the Optional class?

* Reduces boilerplate code
* No more NullPointerException at runtime
* Expressive and easy to understand code
* Helps in designing clean APIs by not returning nulls from methods

10. What is the @FunctionalInterface?

Functional interfaces are those that contain only one abstract method, 
and they can be used as the assignment target for lambda expressions and method references.

11. what is lamda?

A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. 
Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.

12. What is Method Reference?

Method reference is a shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method.
It's a concise way to express instances of functional interfaces.

13. What is Java 8 new features?

They are language features introduced in Java 8, including:
* Lambda Expressions
* Method References
* Stream API
* Default Methods in Interfaces
* New Date and Time API
* Optional Class

14. Lambda can use unchanged variable outside of lambda? what is the details?

Variables referenced from a lambda expression must be final or effectively final. 
An effectively final variable is one whose value does not change after it is first assigned.

15. Describe the newly added features in Java 8?

See Q13

16. Can a functional interface extend/inherit another interface?

Yes, but only if it does not introduce an abstract method beyond the original functional interface's single abstract method.

17.  What is the lambda expression in Java and How does a lambda expression relate to a functional interface?

A lambda expression can be understood as a concise representation of an anonymous function.
A lambda expression is a way to provide a direct implementation of an abstract method defined by a functional interface.

18. In Java 8, what is Method Reference?

See Q12

19. What does the String::ValueOf expression mean?

It converts data from its internal form into a human-readable form. It is a static method that is overloaded within a string for all of Javaâ€™s built-in types so that each type can be converted properly into a string.

20. What are Intermediate and Terminal operations?

They are operations used in Stream api.
Streams in Java 8 support a series of operations that can be classified as intermediate or terminal. 
Intermediate operations return a stream and allow for further operations. 
Terminal operations return a non-stream result or produce a side effect and close the stream.

21. What are the most commonly used Intermediate operations?

* map: Transforms each element of the stream.
* filter: Excludes elements that don't match a given condition.
* sorted: Sorts the elements based on a comparator.

22. What is the difference between findFirst() and findAny()?

findFirst() returns the first element from the stream, which is significant in ordered streams.

findAny() returns any element from the stream.

23. How are Collections different from Stream?

Collections are in-memory data structures which hold elements within them. 
Each element in a collection can be accessed or removed, and we can add elements to a collection as well. Collections are all about storing and accessing data.

Streams, on the other hand, are about computations on data sources, where the data source could be a collection, an array, a generator function, or an I/O channel. 
Streams allow you to perform filter-map-reduce-like operations on data. 
They do not store data themselves but allow the flow of data from a source, through a pipeline of operations, and then to a destination.
