#### 7. How to stash your new code before leaving branch branch_learn_stash and pop your stash when you checkout back to branch_learn_stash ? try commands way and intellij way.

```bash
git stash

git switch other_branch

git switch branch_learn_stach

git stach pop
```

Intellij

1. **Switch to `branch_learn_stash`**: Use the branch switcher at the bottom-right corner to switch to `branch_learn_stash`.
2. **Stash Changes**: Go to `VCS` > `Git` > `Stash Changes...`, enter a name for your stash if desired, and click 'Stash'.

3. **Switch Back to `branch_learn_stash`**: Use the branch switcher.

4. **Apply a Stash**: Go to `VCS` > `Git` > `Unstash Changes...`, select the stash you want to apply, and click 'Pop'.



#### 8. How do you understand PR is based on Branch?

- Branch: a branch represents an independent line of development in a project, enabling developers to work in parallel without affecting the stable version of the project, often referred to as the main or master branch.

#### 9. What is maven role ? what it be used to do ?

Maven is a powerful project management and comprehension tool that is widely used in Java. Its primary role is to facilitate the build process of software projects, but it offers more than just compiling code.

Some uses of Maven

- Project Structure
- Dependency Management
- Build Automation
- Project Lifecycle Management
- Plugins and Extensibility
- CI/CD
- Repository Management



#### 10. What is the lifecycle of maven? could you tell me the details ?

The lifecycle of a Maven project is the sequence of steps through which the project goes during its build. These steps are executed in order.

1. Clean: Cleans up the project by removing all files generated by the previous build
2. Prepare resources: Copy resources from the project's source directories to the output directory/
3. Validate: Validates the project is correct and all necessary informationis available.
4. Compile: Compiles the source code
5. Test: Optional
6. Package: Packages the compiled code in its distributable format such as JAR
7. Install: Installs the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally.
8. Deploy: Copy the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.



#### 11. what is the difference between package and install in maven lifecycle ?

- Package: Packages the compiled code in its distributable format such as JAR
- Install: Installs the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally.



#### 12. What is plugins in maven, list some plugins.

- Maven Compile Plugin
- Maven Surefire Plugin
- Maven JAR Plugin
- Maven WAR Plugin
- Maven Clean Plugin
- Maven Deploy Plugin



#### 13. In **Repo/MavenProject** directory, create a **maven Module** using Intellij, named it as belows:

1. groupID:**com.chuwa.learn**
2. artifactID:**java-core**

- [x] 

- ```xml
  <groupId>com.chuwa.learn</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-core</artifactId>
  ```

#### 14. Do Code Review: Go over the PRs in your repo, tried to leave some useful or useful comments in other students' PR, please don't merge it.
