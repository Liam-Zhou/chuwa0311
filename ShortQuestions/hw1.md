3. What is the basic steps to init a git repo in you local ?

```
cd repo_dir
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit comments"
```

4. How to clone a repo from Github ?

```
git clone <repo_url>
```

5. How to create a new branch and checkout to that branch ?

```
git branch <branch_name>
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

6. How to merge the branch_test to master branch in command ? show me the commands

```
git checkout master
git merge branch_test
```

7. How to stash your new code before leaving branch branch_learn_stash and pop your stash when you
   checkout back to branch_learn_stash ? try commands way and intellij way.

```
git stash push
git checkout another_branch
git checkout branch_learn_stash
git stash pop
```

```
In IntelliJ IDEA, make sure your changes are saved.
Open the Version Control tool window by clicking on "Version Control" on the bottom left or pressing Alt + 9.
Under the "Local Changes" tab, you'll see your changes.
Right-click on the changes you want to stash and select "Git" -> "Stash Changes...".
Optionally, provide a description for your stash and click "OK".
Checkout to Another Branch:

In IntelliJ IDEA, open the Branches tool window by clicking on "Git" -> "Branches" or pressing Ctrl + Shift + `.
Select the branch you want to switch to (e.g., master) and checkout to that branch.
Pop Stash:

After you've done your work on the other branch, and you want to return to branch_learn_stash:
Open the Branches tool window again.
Select branch_learn_stash branch.
Right-click on the branch and choose "Git" -> "Pop Stash".
IntelliJ IDEA will apply the changes from the stash onto your current branch (branch_learn_stash).
```

8. How do you understand PR is based on Branch?

When you create a pull request, you're essentially asking others to review your changes and consider merging them into the target branch. 
As a result, When you create a pull request, you're specifying a source branch and a target branch.

9. What is maven role ? what it be used to do ?

Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It manages project builds, dependencies, and documentation.

10. What is the lifecycle of maven? could you tell me the details ?

Clean Lifecycle:

clean: Removes all files generated by the previous build.

Default Lifecycle:

validate: Validates the project structure and configuration.
compile: Compiles the source code of the project.
test: Runs unit tests using a suitable unit testing framework.
package: Packages the compiled code into a distributable format, such as a JAR or WAR file.
verify: Runs integration tests to verify the correctness of the package.
install: Installs the package into the local Maven repository for use in other projects.
deploy: Copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers or projects.

Site Lifecycle:

site: Generates project documentation and reports.
site-deploy: Deploys generated documentation to a web server.

11. what is the difference between package and install in maven lifecycle ?

Package: Compiles code and generates a JAR/WAR file

Install: Places the generated package into the local Maven repository

12. What is plugins in maven, list some plugins.

In Maven, plugins are software components that provide specific functionality to the build process. 
Plugins are executed during different phases of the Maven lifecycle to perform tasks such as compiling code, running tests, packaging applications, generating documentation, and deploying artifacts. 
Maven plugins are configured in the project's POM (Project Object Model) file and are responsible for carrying out various build-related operations. Examples include:

maven-compiler-plugin: Compiles Java source code.

maven-surefire-plugin: Runs unit tests.

maven-jar-plugin: Packages code into a JAR file.

maven-war-plugin: Creates web application WAR files.

maven-install-plugin: Installs artifacts into the local repository.

maven-deploy-plugin: Deploys artifacts to a remote repository.
