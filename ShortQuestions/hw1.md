+ git add . 
+ git commit -m ""
+ git push
+ git merge
+ git stash

+ git pull

        
**3.  What is the basic steps to init a git repo in you local ?**

        git init
**4.  How to clone a repo from Github ?**

        git clone repo_url

**5.  How to create a new branch and checkout to that branch ?**

        git checkout -b branchName

**6.  How to merge the branch_test to master branch in command ? show me the commands**

        git checkout master
        git merge branch_test

**7.  How to stash your new code before leaving branch branch_learn_stash**
**and pop your stash when you checkout back to branch_learn_stash ? try commands way and intellij way.**
    
        git stash
        git stash pop

**8.  How do you understand PR is based on Branch?**

        In my general idea, I think PR ccan help developer to develop 
        isolated we can make some on my own without ruin the whole system 
        and teams can dicuss if they need this changes, it can helps a lot on the workflow

**9.  What is maven role ? what it be used to do ?**

        Maven can build the project, manage the dependcy, and it contains the life cycle management
        In addition, it can contains some useful plugins and Continuous Intergration and Devepolyment

**10.  What is the lifecycle of maven? could you tell me the details ?**

**Default Lifecycle**

+ validate: Checks if all necessary information is available and valid.
+ compile: Compiles the source code of the project.
+ practice1: Runs tests using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed.
+ package: Packages the compiled code into its distributable format, such as a JAR or WAR. 
+ verify: Runs any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria. 
+ install: Installs the package into the local repository, which can then be used as a dependency in other projects locally. 
+ deploy: Copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects. 
+ These phases are executed sequentially to complete the build process. For example, executing the mvn install command will run not only the install phase but also all preceding phases in the Default lifecycle (validate, compile, practice1, package, verify).

**Clean Lifecycle**

+ pre-clean: Executes tasks needed before the actual project cleaning.
+ clean: Removes all files generated by the previous build.
+ post-clean: Executes tasks needed to finalize the cleaning process.
+ Executing the mvn clean command runs the clean phase, which typically removes the target directory where Maven stores all the output of the build.

**Site Lifecycle**
+ pre-site: Executes tasks needed before the site generation.
+ site: Generates the project's site documentation.
+ post-site: Executes tasks needed to finalize the site generation, such as linking generated documentation.
+ site-deploy: Deploys the generated site documentation to a specified web server.

**11.  what is the difference between package and install in maven lifecycle ?**

    package: compiled code and resources of the project, and packages them into a distributable 
    format, such as a JAR, WAR, or EAR file
    install: takes the package generated in the package phase and installs it into the local Maven repository on your machine. 
    This makes the artifact available as a dependency for other projects on your local system.
**12.  What is plugins in maven, list some plugins.**

    maven-surefire-plugin
    maven-jar-plugin
    maven-war-plugin
    maven-clean-plugin
