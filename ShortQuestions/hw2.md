## 1. Write up Example code to demonstrate the three foundmental concepts of OOP. (reference Code Demo repo as example)
```
Encapsulation;
Polymorphism;
Inheritance;
```
## 2. What is wrapper class in Java and Why we need wrapper class?
Wrapper classes in Java are a part of the java.lang package and serve as the object representation of the eight primitive data types. In Java, primitive data types (like int, char, double, etc.) are not objects; they are stored directly in memory and are very fast to access. However, there are situations in Java programming where you need to use objects instead of primitives. This is where wrapper classes come in.

Why need wrapper class:
- To use in Java Collections: Collections such as ArrayList, HashMap, etc., can only store objects and not primitive types. Wrapper classes enable you to store the primitives in these collections by wrapping them in their corresponding object representation.
- Since wrapper classes are objects, they can have methods and properties which can be very useful. 
- Primitives cannot be null, but their wrapper class objects can be. This is useful for representing a lack of a value or checking if a value has been assigned.

## 3. What is the difference between HashMap and HashTable?

## 4. What is String pool in Java and why we need String pool?

## 5. What is Java garbage collection?

## 6. What are access modifiers and their scopes in Java?
| Modifier | Description |
|----------|----------|
| Default    | declarations are visible only within the package (package private)     |
| Private    | declarations are visible within the class only    |
| Protected    | declarations are visible within the package or all subclasses    |
| Public    | declarations are visible everywhere    |
