## 1. What is generic type in Java?

Generic type is same with the idea of meta programming, it allows you define a sequence of behavior without speicify the object. It is similar to C++'s template class
For example, the List<T> is a generic type, at the time you define it, you have no idea what T is, T can be Integer, Charaters or something else. List it self includes some functionality, but you do not need to know what T is to define those functionality.
