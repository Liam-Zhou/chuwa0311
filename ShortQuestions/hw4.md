# Homework 4

## 1. practice collection
Please refer to coding folder

## 2.What is the checked exception and unchecked exception
- checked exception will be check during compile time, you must deal with it by throws an exception
- unchecked exception is checking during run time, and you will not know if it will throw an exception or not until runtime, NullPointerException and OutOfBoundException is unchecked exception.

## 3. Can there be multiple final block?
No

## 4. Both catch and finally return result, what's the value?
finally will supersede the previous catch result, so the value will be finally return result.

## 5. What is Runtime/unchecked exception? What is compile/checked exception?

 - compile/checked exception: exception will be checked during compile time, it must be catch or throw
   - IOException
   - SQLException/NetworkException
 - Runtime/unchecked exception: is the exception occur during run time, you do not have to handle it
   - NullPointerException
   - IndexOutOfBoundsException

## 6. What is the difference between throw and throws
throw keyword throw one exception, and it will inside of the method or block of code
```
throw new Exception("something went wrong");
```
throws keyword is using in the method signiture, and it can throw multiple exception
```
public void myMethod() throws IOException {
    // Method code that might throw an IOException
}
```

## 7. why do we put the Null/Runtime exception before Exception ?
We suppose to put smaller scope Exception first, and larger scope exception after, there are two reasons

 - if we put Exception first, Exception will catch everything, Null/Runtime exception will never have a chance to catch anything and will be useless.
 - it can increase the effeciency.

## 8. What is Optional? Why do we use it? Write an Optional example
Optional is a container that you may or may not have an object in it. 

We use Optional mainly for dealing with the null check problem, without Optional, we suppose check null everytime when we use the object, otherwise we may encounter the NullPointerException. To deal with that, we may need to write many if check. Using Optional can significantly reduce code.

```
Optional<String> emptyOptional = Optional.empty();
```
## 8. Why finally always be executed
Since finally block will do cleanup and finalization of the task, so it will always execute to make sure everything will be ok

## 9. Practice collection
Please refer to Codings folder

## 10. What are the types of design patterns in Java?
- Creational Pattern
- Structural Pattern
- Behavioral Pattern

## 11.What are the SOLID principle
Five roles to make designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable

- Signle Responsibility Principle
- Open/Close Principle
- Liskov substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

## 12. How can you achieve thread-safe singleton patterns in Java
You can use static inner class (Lazy load) to hold the Singleton instance to make sure thread-safety.

## 13.What do you understande by the Open-closed principle (OCP)?
Software entities (class, modules, functions, etc) should be open for extension but close for modification.

So the principle suggests that once a class or module is created and tested, it should be designed in a way that allows it to be easily extended to accommodate new functionalities or requirements without requiring changes to it existing code.

## 14. Liskovâ€™s substitution principle states that if class B is a subtype of class A, then object of type A may be substituted with any object of type B. What does this actually mean? (from OA ) choose your answer.
1. It means that if the object of type A can do something, the object of type B could also be able to perform the same thing.

## 15. Watch the design pattern video, and type the code, submit it to MavenProject folder
Refer to the Codings folder
